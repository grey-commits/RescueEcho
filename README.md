üö® RescueEcho

AI-powered radar-based survivor detection system for disaster response

RescueEcho is a micro-Doppler-based target classification system that leverages AI and radar signals to distinguish between humans and inanimate objects in disaster scenarios. Designed for low-visibility conditions like collapsed buildings or debris-covered zones, it aids first responders by identifying survivors quickly and accurately.
